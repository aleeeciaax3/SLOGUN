SloGUN
======
SloGUN is a social platform built specifically for the Midwest.  Inspired from Raygun's (www.raygunsite.com) twisted sense of Midwest pride, SloGUN gives you the opportunity to submit a quippy, true, or simply funny slogan that embodies the great flyover states.  

Everyone in the community can view, vote, and comment on your slogan, and the popularity it garners could land it on the “Trending” or “All-Time” top pages.  This social interaction is made possible through a backend running on Google App Engine (https://github.com/PeteStreet/raygun-app-backend).  

In addition to a “Home” page, there are numerous subcategories that hone in on more local communities within the Midwest.  When you post a slogan you have the option to tag it with two relevant subcategories, thereby making it show up in each of those pages as well.  The “Home” page is an amalgamation of slogans from all of the different subcategories.  

SloGUN is for the natives and captives in equal measure.  The kinds of people who love, and love to hate, the Midwest.

***NOTE***  Some of the final features won’t be implemented until next week.  These include a coherent login screen, slogan tags, the ability to actually post slogans from within the app, and some styling improvements.
